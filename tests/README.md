# Notice for the tests folder

Assuming each team has properly parameterized their functions, tests may be added
on a feature-by-feature basis without compatibility issues. Please refer to a naming
convention similar to what is present in the `src` folder, such as `test_file_feature.py`
and `test_mining_commits.py`. These tests may be collected under larger test modules,
but should be capable of operating independently as well.
