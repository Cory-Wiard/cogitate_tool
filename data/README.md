# Notice for the data folder

`demofile.json`, as the name suggests, is a prototype template for our data handling
model. The actual file we will be populating is `contributor_data.json`. This file,
along with `demofile.json`, will be removed once a concrete structure has been established
for `contributor_data.json`. Please refer to `demofile.json` as the template for
data handling at this time.
