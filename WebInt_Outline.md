[Helpful link for Streamlit API info, types of visualizations supported.](https://docs.streamlit.io/api.html)



Look at each data and whether or not it will be team or individually displayed.
Discuss with teams how they plan on displaying data and start working on demo.


| How many commits did an individual make to a GitHub repository? | Line Chart |

This will be shown as a line chart showing commits of each individual with the
x axis representing time and y axis the number of commits. Will have to option
to combine individuals to see team commits

| How many lines of code did an individual add, modify, and delete? | Bar graph |

To be determined

| Why types of files did an individual normally modify in a repository? | Pie Graph |  

This could be shown as a pie chart with each file filling up some of the circle.
Still need to discuss with team how they plan to show data

| What is the overall score for an individual’s contribution to a team project? | Line/bar Chart |

This will be shown using a bar chart for each individuals score. How will the
teams overall score be shown? still need to talk to teams about how they display 
data.
