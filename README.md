#### Steps to run `count_code_lines.py`

- Run the python file using `pipenv run python count_code_lines.py`
- Paste the URL or local path of the repository
- __NOTE__: the program only displays statistics for the default master branch of the repository if run using repository URL. However, it would display the checked out branch statistics if the local path was provided. This is a current limitation of pydriller

#### Run the test suite

- Run test suite using the command: `pipenv run test`
- Enter the URL or the local path of the repository
